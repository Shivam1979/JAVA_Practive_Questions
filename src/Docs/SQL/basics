1. *What is SQL, and what is it used for?*

  SQL stand for Structured Query Language it is used to intract with the relational database to
    intract and organise the data of database

    and it used to communicate the databases to perform the some operations in data








2. *Explain the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.*
           SQL ------------------------------------------------------------NoSQL
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    i)Relational databases                                 Non -relational databases
   ii) vertically Scalable                                 Horizontally Scalable
   iii)Uses ACID property                                  Use BASE property
   iv) It is used to when correct data is important        When Fast data is important than correct data









3. *What are the different types of SQL JOINs, and how do they work?*
   Join is used to join two or more table , when tha data of table is not sufficient  to analyze then we use
   join

   Type of join
   1).  Inner join   2).Outer join> Left join , Right join , Full join  3).  Self join  4).  Cross Join


                        Let left Table is A and Right table is B

  Inner join---> Inner join return the intersection of both of the table or matching record of
  the both of the table

  Syntax : SELECT * FROM  A as a inner join B as b on a.* = b.* ; return the A∩B;
  Outer join
  Left Join --->Left join return all the matching record of the right table B and all the record of A
  Syntax : SELECT * FROM A as a Left join B as b on a.* = b.* ; retunn  A U (A∩B);

  Right  Join --->Left join return all the matching record of the left  table B and all the record of right table
  Syntax : SELECT * FROM B as b Left join A as a on a.* = b.* ; retunn  B U (A∩B);

  Full  Join --->Left join return all the matching and non- Matching record of both of the table
  Syntax : SELECT * FROM A as a Full join B as b on a.* = b.* ; retunn  A U B;

   Self   Join --->Left join return all the matching and non- Matching record of both of the table
  Syntax : SELECT * FROM A as a self  join A as a on a.* = a.*  Condition ; retunn  A*;

  Cross Join : it combine each row of left table from each row of right table
  Syntax : SELECT * FROM A as a cross  join B as b on a.* = b.*  Condition ;








4. *How do you retrieve all records from a table?*
 for all record of table we use Star(*)
 SELECT * FROM TABLE A;
 SELECT * FROM TABLE B;
 SELECT * FROM TABLE C;








 5. *What is a primary key, and why is it important?*
 Primary key is key that uniquely identify in tuple of table , it can not be null and uplicate

 It is important because
     by using the primary key we can esily   search and get the data from record ,
     it can not be duplicate so the all record will be distinct to perform some specific operation in
     certain condition








6. *What is an index in a database, and why would you use one?*

   index is the data structure that provide the quickly access of specific information without read all the data
   * it is used to improve the performance

\












7. *Explain the concept of normalization in databases.*
   Normalization is the process to organize the table it break the bigger table in to the smaller table
   it remove the duplicate data from the table
   
T ypes of normalization
i) 1NF
ii)2NF
iii)3NF
iv) BCNF(Boyce Codd normal form)







8. *What is a foreign key, and how does it relate to primary keys?*

    Foreign key is the key is the column or group of column that show the relationship between two table ,
    and it points a primary key of another table
    * forein key can be null
    *Foreign key can be duplicate also



9. *Write a SQL query to find the second highest salary in a table.*

SELECT * FROM employee order by DESC limit 1,1;









10. *What is a subquery, and how is it different from a JOIN?*
  subquery is the nested query inside the query  subquery is used to perform the complex calculation and filtring


 # Subquery is more flexible than join because they can handle diffrent data & Operations
 # We can perform the subquery where we can not apply join
 # Subquery is easy to understand for beginners than Joins
